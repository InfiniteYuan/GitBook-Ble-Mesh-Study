# Bluetooth mesh Guide

Bluetooth has been actively developed since its initial release in 2000, when it was originally intended to act as a cable replacement technology. It soon came to dominate wireless audio products and computer peripherals such as wireless mice and keyboards.

> 自从 2000 年最初发布蓝牙以来，它就一直在积极发展，当时蓝牙最初旨在用作电缆替代技术。很快，它成为无线音频产品和计算机外围设备（如无线鼠标和键盘）的主导。

In 2010, Bluetooth LE provided the next, major step forward. Its impact has been substantial and widely felt, most notably in smartphones and tablets, as well as in Health and Fitness, Smart Home and Wearables categories.

> 在 2010 年，Bluetooth LE 向前迈出了重要的下一步。它的影响是巨大而广泛的，尤其是在智能手机和平板电脑以及健康和健身，智能家居和可穿戴设备类别中。

Wireless communications systems based around mesh network topologies have proved themselves to offer an effective approach to providing coverage of large areas, extending range and providing resilience. However, until now they have been based upon niche technologies, incompatible with most computer, smartphone and accessory devices owned by consumers or used in the enterprise.

> 事实证明，基于网状\(mesh\)网络拓扑的无线通信系统可以提供一种有效的方法来覆盖大范围，扩展范围并提供弹性。但是，直到现在，它们还是基于 niche 技术，与消费者拥有或企业使用的大多数计算机，智能手机和附件设备不兼容。

The addition of mesh networking support represents a change of a type, and of such magnitude that it warrants being described as a paradigm shift for Bluetooth technology.

> 网状\(mesh\)网络支持的增加代表了一种类型的变化，并且这种变化的程度足以保证将其描述为蓝牙技术的范式转变。

In July of 2017, the Bluetooth SIG released Mesh Profile Specification v1.0 which describes a mesh profile running on top of any device version 4.0 or newer.

> 2017年7月，蓝牙 SIG 联盟发布了[《Mesh Profile Specification v1.0》](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/mesh-specifications/)，该版本描述了在 4.0 版本或更高版本的任何设备上运行的 Mesh Profile。
